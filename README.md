# Rodgers M Gitau 

## Description

Welcome to my personal blog/factory where I experiment with ideas and try to build them out. Sometimes I make some very useful things but I always have fun, craft interesting contraptions and learn something new.


## Who is this dude?

Hi, I'm [Rodgers M Gitau](https://rodgersgitau.vercel.app) a software engineer & *tinkerer* from Nairobi, Kenya. 

I've always loved to tinker ever since I could remember. Taking apart random things and tring to figure out how it worked has left me with very many lessons and lots of dis-assembled junk :wink;

## What to expect?

In here you'll find my musings, experiments with code and maybe something pretty cool. Every often my very old-fashioned Gen-Y sense of culture will lead to some elaborate exploration of the absolute mundane of things.
