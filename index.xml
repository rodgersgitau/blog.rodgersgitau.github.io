      <description>A bit more about me &amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m Rodgers M Gitau, a software engineer based in Nairobi, Kenya. I specialize in building web applications that are performant, accessible and focused on the user experience.
My professional journey started with a regular IT desk job with a leading hospitality group. During this period of about 5 years, I tried to get into coding but with so much work to do, I never actually begun.</description>
